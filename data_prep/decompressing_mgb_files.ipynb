        "\n",
        "- **Compression Techniques**:\n",
        "  - Redundancies in the reads and IDs were removed.\n",
        "  - Quality scores may have been quantized or entropy-coded.\n",
        "  - Optional reference-based compression could align reads to a known genome and store only differences.\n",
